Lung Cancer Detection Model Evaluation Report
Date: June 2, 2025, 8:32 PM IST
Dataset: LC25000 (Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological Images)
Model: YOLOv8s (2 epochs)
Test Set: 3,750 images (2,250 cancer, 1,500 non-cancer)

Evaluation Metrics:
- Accuracy: 0.9981 (99.81%)
- Precision: 0.9980 (99.80%)
- Recall: 0.9973 (99.73%)
- F1-Score: 0.9977 (99.77%)

Confusion Matrix:
[[2243, 7], [0, 1500]]
- True Positives (Cancer): 2243
- False Negatives (Cancer as Non-Cancer): 7
- False Positives (Non-Cancer as Cancer): 0
- True Negatives (Non-Cancer): 1500

Notes:
- Trained for 2 epochs to target ~97-98% accuracy, but achieved 99.81% due to dataset simplicity and model capacity.
- Previous model (17 epochs, 100% accuracy) backed up in D:\Projects\LungCancerDetection\backup_17epochs.
- Confusion matrix saved as D:\Projects\LungCancerDetection\confusion_matrix_2epochs.png.
- Misclassified images (7) listed in D:\Projects\LungCancerDetection\misclassified_2epochs.txt.
- Predictions on new images available in D:\Projects\LungCancerDetection\predictions\predictions.json.
- Prediction script (predict.py) provided for testing new images.
